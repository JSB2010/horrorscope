# horrorscope
This is a fun tool where it gives you a fake horoscope based on your birthday. This is a completely random program.

This app is based on a Python program, which I then turned into a .app file with pyinstaller. I also created a .dmg with this app, and a .pkg installer for anyone to install this on to thier Mac. If you have any suggestions for what to do next, let me know, I am always looking for new ideas. Thanks!
